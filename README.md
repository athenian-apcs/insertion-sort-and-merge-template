# Insertion Sort and Merge

For homework, you will write two methods relating to sorting. **You don't need to use recursion for either of these methods**!

First, finish writing the code from class where you were working on insertion sort. Here is the general pseudocode for insertion sort:

* Create a new ArrayList (this will be the sorted output list)
* Loop through the original list:
  * Get the next element that you are inserting
  * Find the index that this element should be inserted at (you can find this by looping through the output list; the element should be inserted before the first number in the output list that is larger than it)
  * Insert the element at this index
* Return the output list

Your method should have the following signature:

```shell script
public static ArrayList<Integer> insertionSort(ArrayList<Integer> list) { }
```

<br />
<br />

Next, write a method to implement the merge method. As a reminder, the merge method takes two sorted arrays as input and returns one large, combined sorted array.

Here is the pseudocode for merge:
* Start at the beginning of both input arrays
* Take the smaller of the two values and add it to the output array
* Repeat until weâ€™ve gone through all of the values in one of the arrays
* Copy the remaining values from the the other array into the output array


The method should have the following signature:
```shell script
public static int[] merge(int[] arr1, int[] arr2) { }
```

## Run your code with:
```shell script
make run
```

## Run your tests with:
```shell script
make test
```
